description: Jerry noticed that the grocer gave his charge customers candy on the
  days they paid their monthly bill, and he wished that his mother wouldn't pay cash.
  So he decided that he would keep the cash when he went to the store, charge the
  groceries, and get the candy when he had to pay the bill, and nobody would lose.
  But it wasn't as easy as Jerry thought to store all of the money.
